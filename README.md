## Description of the project

This challenge consisted in building a personal portfolio using the recently learned REACT tool for the elaboration of the user interface. The portfolio should contain the options "about me", "the portfolio", an option for "contact" and another one to download a summary.

The main motivation for this challenge was to put into action the recent knowledge acquired from REACT, with this framework or library we are looking for a simpler user interface with the possibility of mixing HTML and Java script languages. Although at the time of coding it seems simple, within the applications we now have more elements, including react components, so it does imply a greater organization at the time of planning the application and being able to identify where the components would make the most sense possible. 

The functions that the portfolio had to fulfill are basically to show information, a very simple capture format and to download a file, really are activities that we could say "simple" since it did not imply the connection with a database, nor call routes to make CRUD operations.   But the difficulty was in the way to build the HTML methods or procedures now with the REACT vision.

When building the REACT components it seems that we were remaking the traditional HTML methods, to call them from the application (including PROPS parameters) and use them as utilities that make it easier to display information in the user interface.

During the construction of the routines I learned that in many cases it was necessary to import the elements either images or files so that they could be properly used in the REACT functions. This was the case of the option to download a file, this routine worked correctly until I previously imported the file (in PDF format) so that I could place it in a control to download it and only then it worked.

Again I recognize that adding REACT to the battery of knowledge that we are acquiring puts me in front of the possibility of building routines or utilities, and build a library that allows me to reuse the code and avoid retyping.
